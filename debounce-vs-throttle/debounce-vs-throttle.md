# Debounce:
    => It's a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed, particularly in response 
    to rapidly occuring events such as user input. It ensures that a function is only called after specific delay
    has passed since the last time the event was triggered. This helps to improve performance and prevent unnecessary actions:


# Throttling:
    => It's a techinque used to limit the rate which a function is executed. It ensures that a function s called
      at most once within a specified time interval, regardless of how many times the event that triggers it occurs.
      This is useful dealing with events that **fire rapidly**, such as scrolling, resizing, or typing.
